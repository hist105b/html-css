                <h2>Lady Susan</h2>
                <p>The following is the first few letters of Jane Austen's novella Lady Susan. The text is taken from the <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/946/pg946-images.html#link2H_4_0001">Project Gutenberg E-book</a>. This early work was not published during Austen's lifetime. It is a work of Epistolary fiction, meaning that the narrative is related through letters and other documents passed between the characters.</p>

                    <p>MY DEAR BROTHER,—I can no longer refuse myself the pleasure of profiting by your kind invitation when we last parted of spending some weeks with you at Churchhill, and, therefore, if quite convenient to you and Mrs. Vernon to receive me at present, I shall hope within a few days to be introduced to a sister whom I have so long desired to be acquainted with. My kind friends here are most affectionately urgent with me to prolong my stay, but their hospitable and cheerful dispositions lead them too much into society for my present situation and state of mind; and I impatiently look forward to the hour when I shall be admitted into your delightful retirement.</p>
                    <p>I long to be made known to your dear little children, in whose hearts I shall be very eager to secure an interest. I shall soon have need for all my fortitude, as I am on the point of separation from my own daughter. The long illness of her dear father prevented my paying her that attention which duty and affection equally dictated, and I have too much reason to fear that the governess to whose care I consigned her was unequal to the charge. I have therefore resolved on placing her at one of the best private schools in town, where I shall have an opportunity of leaving her myself in my way to you. I am determined, you see, not to be denied admittance at Churchhill. It would indeed give me most painful sensations to know that it were not in your power to receive me.</p>
                    <p>Adieu, I will send you a line as soon as I arrive in town.</p>
                    <div class="signature"><p>Yours ever,<br>S. Vernon.</p></div>

                    <h4>Lady Susan Vernon to Mrs. Johnson</h4>
                    <p class="location">Langford.</p>
                    <p>You were mistaken, my dear Alicia, in supposing me fixed at this place for the rest of the winter: it grieves me to say how greatly you were mistaken, for I have seldom spent three months more agreeably than those which have just flown away. At present, nothing goes smoothly; the females of the family are united against me. You foretold how it would be when I first came to Langford, and Mainwaring is so uncommonly pleasing that I was not without apprehensions for myself. I remember saying to myself, as I drove to the house, “I like this man, pray Heaven no harm come of it!” But I was determined to be discreet, to bear in mind my being only four months a widow, and to be as quiet as possible: and I have been so, my dear creature; I have admitted no one’s attentions but Mainwaring’s. I have avoided all general flirtation whatever; I have distinguished no creature besides, of all the numbers resorting hither, except Sir James Martin, on whom I bestowed a little notice, in order to detach him from Miss Mainwaring; but, if the world could know my motive there they would honour me. I have been called an unkind mother, but it was the sacred impulse of maternal affection, it was the advantage of my daughter that led me on; and if that daughter were not the greatest simpleton on earth, I might have been rewarded for my exertions as I ought.</p>
                    <p>Sir James did make proposals to me for Frederica; but Frederica, who was born to be the torment of my life, chose to set herself so violently against the match that I thought it better to lay aside the scheme for the present. I have more than once repented that I did not marry him myself; and were he but one degree less contemptibly weak I certainly should: but I must own myself rather romantic in that respect, and that riches only will not satisfy me. The event of all this is very provoking: Sir James is gone, Maria highly incensed, and Mrs. Mainwaring insupportably jealous; so jealous, in short, and so enraged against me, that, in the fury of her temper, I should not be surprized at her appealing to her guardian, if she had the liberty of addressing him: but there your husband stands my friend; and the kindest, most amiable action of his life was his throwing her off for ever on her marriage. Keep up his resentment, therefore, I charge you. We are now in a sad state; no house was ever more altered; the whole party are at war, and Mainwaring scarcely dares speak to me. It is time for me to be gone; I have therefore determined on leaving them, and shall spend, I hope, a comfortable day with you in town within this week. If I am as little in favour with Mr. Johnson as ever, you must come to me at 10 Wigmore street; but I hope this may not be the case, for as Mr. Johnson, with all his faults, is a man to whom that great word “respectable” is always given, and I am known to be so intimate with his wife, his slighting me has an awkward look.</p>
                        
                    <p>I take London in my way to that insupportable spot, a country village; for I am really going to Churchhill. Forgive me, my dear friend, it is my last resource. Were there another place in England open to me I would prefer it. Charles Vernon is my aversion; and I am afraid of his wife. At Churchhill, however, I must remain till I have something better in view. My young lady accompanies me to town, where I shall deposit her under the care of Miss Summers, in Wigmore street, till she becomes a little more reasonable. She will made good connections there, as the girls are all of the best families. The price is immense, and much beyond what I can ever attempt to pay.</p>
                        
                    <p>Adieu, I will send you a line as soon as I arrive in town.</p>

                    <p>
                        My dear Mother,—I am very sorry to tell you that it will not be in our
                        power to keep our promise of spending our Christmas with you; and we are
                        prevented that happiness by a circumstance which is not likely to make us any
                        amends. Lady Susan, in a letter to her brother-in-law, has declared her
                        intention of visiting us almost immediately; and as such a visit is in all
                        probability merely an affair of convenience, it is impossible to conjecture its
                        length. I was by no means prepared for such an event, nor can I now account for
                        her ladyship’s conduct; Langford appeared so exactly the place for her in
                        every respect, as well from the elegant and expensive style of living there, as
                        from her particular attachment to Mr. Mainwaring, that I was very far from
                        expecting so speedy a distinction, though I always imagined from her increasing
                        friendship for us since her husband’s death that we should, at some
                        future period, be obliged to receive her. Mr. Vernon, I think, was a great deal
                        too kind to her when he was in Staffordshire; her behaviour to him, independent
                        of her general character, has been so inexcusably artful and ungenerous since
                        our marriage was first in agitation that no one less amiable and mild than
                        himself could have overlooked it all; and though, as his brother’s widow,
                        and in narrow circumstances, it was proper to render her pecuniary assistance,
                        I cannot help thinking his pressing invitation to her to visit us at Churchhill
                        perfectly unnecessary. Disposed, however, as he always is to think the best of
                        everyone, her display of grief, and professions of regret, and general
                        resolutions of prudence, were sufficient to soften his heart and make him
                        really confide in her sincerity; but, as for myself, I am still unconvinced,
                        and plausibly as her ladyship has now written, I cannot make up my mind till I
                        better understand her real meaning in coming to us. You may guess, therefore,
                        my dear madam, with what feelings I look forward to her arrival. She will have
                        occasion for all those attractive powers for which she is celebrated to gain
                        any share of my regard; and I shall certainly endeavour to guard myself against
                        their influence, if not accompanied by something more substantial. She
                        expresses a most eager desire of being acquainted with me, and makes very
                        gracious mention of my children but I am not quite weak enough to suppose a
                        woman who has behaved with inattention, if not with unkindness, to her own
                        child, should be attached to any of mine. Miss Vernon is to be placed at a
                        school in London before her mother comes to us which I am glad of, for her sake
                        and my own. It must be to her advantage to be separated from her mother, and a
                        girl of sixteen who has received so wretched an education, could not be a very
                        desirable companion here. Reginald has long wished, I know, to see the
                        captivating Lady Susan, and we shall depend on his joining our party soon. I am
                        glad to hear that my father continues so well; and am, with best love, &amp;c.,
